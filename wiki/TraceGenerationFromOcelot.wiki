#summary Create GPU traces from what GPUOcelot provided.

= Introduction =

GPUOcelot provides many applications from different suites (CUDA SDK, Rodinia, Parboil).

To generate traces from these benchmarks, you can simply need to change the SConscript file in the suite directory.


= Example = 

You have to modify/add following in $GPUOcelot/cuda4.1sdk/SConscript


LIBS=additionalLibs + ['-lglut', '-locelot', libsdk, '-lGLEW', '-lGLU', '-locelotTrace', '-lz', '-lboost_thread-mt', '-lboost_serialization-mt', '-lboost_wserialization-mt', '-lboost_filesystem-mt', '-lboost_system-mt'])


Then, you just need to build the entire suite and run it. 

 # Note that binaries are usually located in .release_build directory. You need to find it from the directory.
 # You need to copy (or create symbolic link) data directory to the .release_build directory.
