#summary MacSim build process

= How to build macsim =

Currently, MacSim support only SCons build process.
Note that we will keep automake process only for the macsim-sst build, which is described in this BuildingMacsimSST.

[http://code.google.com/p/macsim/wiki/BuildingMacsimSST page].

== Requirement ==

 # scons
  * ubuntu
{{{
apt-get install scons
}}}

== Build Steps ==

{{{
./build.py
}}}

 * build options
   * -j (--thread) : specify number of threads for parallel build
   * -d : debug build (-g)
   * -p : gprof build (-pg)
   * -c : clean
   * -t : build test
   * --dramsim : using DRAMSim2
   * --power : power model (with EnergyIntrospector)
   * --iris : Iris interconnection model

 * Note that you can choose either opt (default), dbg, or gpf build, not multiple.

 * However, you can choose any combination of libraries you want (DRAMSim2, EI, Iris).

== Configuration file ==

MacSim provides a top-level configuration file called *macsim.config*. The sample content of the configuration file is as following:

{{{
## MacSim Configuration File

[Build]
debug: 0
gprof: 0

[Library]
dram:  0
power: 0
iris:  0
}}}

Although you can specify these options in the command lines with *build.py*, specifying in this file would make your build process easier.
